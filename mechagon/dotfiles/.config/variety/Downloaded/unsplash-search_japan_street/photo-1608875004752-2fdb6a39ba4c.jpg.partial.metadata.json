    "description": "A rainy evening stroll amongst the vibrant neon streets of Shinjuku, Tokyo. It is said that Ridley Scott was inspired by Shinjukuâ€™s neon landscape when we was filming Blade Runner. And why not, it is easy to find oneself reminiscing of being in a future dystopian city when walking through Shinjuku on a night like this.",
